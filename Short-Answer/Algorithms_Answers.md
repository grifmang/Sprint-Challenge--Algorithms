#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - just one loop


b) O(n^2) - two loops, one nested


c) O(log n) - recursive call working backwards

## Exercise II

    I would use a divide and conquer algorithm. It would start at n/2 and continue dividing
    and testing until it found the right floor.

    I believe this would run O(log n) because it splits n in half on each try.
